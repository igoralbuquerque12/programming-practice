# PROGRAMMING PRACTICE

Welcome to my **programming practice** repository! 

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to various **data structures** and **algorithms** problems that I have solved as part of my learning journey. My objectives with this are to learn more about data structures and save my exercises for future improvement.

## CONTENT

This repository will includes solutions for various exercises:

- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Arrays, Hashmaps, Trees, Stacks, Queues, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, etc.
- **Coding Challenges**: Problem-solving exercises from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

- **linked-lists**: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, and related problems.
- **arrays**: Array manipulation techniques.
- **hashmaps**: Hashmap-based algorithms and problems.
- **trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversal, etc.
- **sorting**: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.
- **searching**: Linear search, binary search, etc.

## HOW TO USE

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/programming-practice.git

2. Run a specific file:
   ```bash
   python ./linked_list.py
